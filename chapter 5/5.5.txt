A. The function performs 2n multiplications and n additions.

B. We can see that the performance-limiting computation here is the repeated
    computation of the expression xpwr = x * xpwr. This requires a floating-
    point multiplication (5 clock cycles), and the computation for one iteration
    cannot begin until the one for the previous iteration has completed. The
    updating of result only requires a floating-point addition (3 clock cycles)
    between successive iterations.
