A. The suffix ‘l’ and the register identifiers indicate 32-bit operands, while the
comparison is for a two’s-complement <. We can infer that data_t must be
int.

B. The suffix ‘w’ and the register identifiers indicate 16-bit operands, while the
comparison is for a two’s-complement >=. We can infer that data_t must be
short.

C. The suffix ‘b’ and the register identifiers indicate 8-bit operands, while
the comparison is for an unsigned <=. We can infer that data_t must be
unsigned char.

D. The suffix ‘q’ and the register identifiers indicate 64-bit operands, while
the comparison is for !=, which is the same whether the arguments are
signed, unsigned, or pointers. We can infer that data_t could be either long,
unsigned long, or some form of pointer.
