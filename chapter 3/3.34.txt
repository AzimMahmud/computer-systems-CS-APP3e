A. We can see that lines 9–14 save local values a0–a5 into callee-saved registers
   %rbx, %r15, %r14, %r13, %r12, and %rbp, respectively.

B. Local values a6 and a7 are stored on the stack at offsets 0 and 8 relative to
   the stack pointer (lines 16 and 18).

C. After storing six local variables, the program has used up the supply of callee-
   saved registers. It stores the remaining two local values on the stack.
