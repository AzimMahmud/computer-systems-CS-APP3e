A. Register %rbx holds the value of parameter x, so that it can be used to
   compute the result expression.


B. The assembly code was generated from the following C code:

   long rfun(unsigned long x) {
        if (x == 0)
            return 0;

        unsigned long nx = x>>2;
        long rv = rfun(nx);

        return x + rv;
    }
