A. The suffix ‘q’ and the register identifiers indicate a 64-bit operand, while the
comparison is for >=, which must be signed. We can infer that data_t must
be long.

B. The suffix ‘w’ and the register identifier indicate a 16-bit operand, while the
comparison is for ==, which is the same for signed or unsigned. We can infer
that data_t must be either short or unsigned short.

C. The suffix ‘b’ and the register identifier indicate an 8-bit operand, while the
comparison is for unsigned >. We can infer that data_t must be unsigned
char.

D. The suffix ‘l’ and the register identifier indicate 32-bit operands, while the
comparison is for <. We can infer that data_t must be int.
