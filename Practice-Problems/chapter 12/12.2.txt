When the parent process on the concurrent server starts executing, the reference
counter increments from 0 to 1 for the associated file table. When this parent
process forks the child process, the reference counter is incremented from 1
to 2. When the parent closes its copy of the descriptor, the reference count is
decremented from 2 to 1. Similarly, when the childâ€™s end of connection closes, the
reference counter is decremented from 1 to 0.
