A. Another approach is to pass the integer i directly, rather than passing a
pointer to i:

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_create(&tid[i], NULL, thread, (void *)i);

In the thread routine, we cast the argument back to an int and assign it to
myid:

    int myid = (int) vargp;
    
B. The advantage is that it reduces overhead by eliminating the calls to malloc
and free. A significant disadvantage is that it assumes that pointers are at
least as large as ints. While this assumption is true for all modern systems,
it might not be true for legacy or future systems.
