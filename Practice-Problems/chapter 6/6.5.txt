A. Worst-case sequential writes (520 MB/s):
    (109 × 128) × (1/520) × (1/(86,400 × 365)) ≈ 7 years

B. Worst-case random writes (205 MB/s):
    (109 × 128) × (1/205) × (1/(86,400 × 365)) ≈ 19 years

C. Average case (50 GB/day):
    (109 × 128) × (1/50,000) × (1/365) ≈ 6,912 years

So even if the SSD operates continuously, it should last for at least 7 years, which
is longer than the expected lifetime of most computers.
