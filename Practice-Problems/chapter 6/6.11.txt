A. With high-order bit indexing, each contiguous array chunk consists of 2t
    blocks, where t is the number of tag bits. Thus, the first 2t contiguous blocks
    of the array would map to set 0, the next 2t blocks would map to set 1, and
    so on.

B. For a direct-mapped cache where (S, E, B, m) = (512, 1, 32, 32), the cache
    capacity is 512 32-byte blocks with t = 18 tag bits in each cache line. Thus, the
    first 218 blocks in the array would map to set 0, the next 218 blocks to set 1.
    Since our array consists of only (4,096 Ã— 4)/32 = 512 blocks, all of the blocks
    in the array map to set 0. Thus, the cache will hold at most 1 array block at
    any point in time, even though the array is small enough to fit entirely in the
    cache. Clearly, using high-order bit indexing makes poor use of the cache.
