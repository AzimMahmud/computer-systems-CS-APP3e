First we need to determine a few basic properties of the file and the disk.
The file consists of 10,000 512-byte logical blocks. For the disk, Tavg seek = 6 ms,
Tmax rotation = 4.61 ms, and Tavg rotation = 2.30 ms.

A. Best case: In the optimal case, the blocks are mapped to contiguous sectors,
    on the same cylinder, that can be read one after the other without moving
    the head. Once the head is positioned over the first sector it takes two full
    rotations (5,000 sectors per rotation) of the disk to read all 10,000 blocks.
    So the total time to read the file is Tavg seek + Tavg rotation + 2 × Tmax rotation =
    6 + 2.30 + 9.22 = 17.52 ms.

B. Random case: In this case, where blocks are mapped randomly to sectors,
    reading each of the 10,000 blocks requires Tavg seek + Tavg rotation ms, so the
    total time to read the file is (Tavg seek + Tavg rotation ) × 10,000 = 83,000 ms
    (83 seconds!).
