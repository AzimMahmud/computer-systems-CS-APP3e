The application makes numerous allocation and free requests to the first size class, followed by numer-
ous allocation and free requests to the second size class, followed by numerous
allocation and free requests to the third size class, and so on. For each size class,
the allocator creates a lot of memory that is never reclaimed because the allocator
doesnâ€™t coalesce, and because the application never requests blocks from that size
class again.
