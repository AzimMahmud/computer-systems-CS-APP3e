A. We can determine the number of lines of output by simply counting the
number of printf vertices in the process graph. In this case,
there are seven such vertices, and thus the program will print seven lines of
output.

B. Any output sequence corresponding to a topological sort of the graph is
possible. For example: Start, 0, 1, Child, Stop, 2, Stop is possible.
