# Lab6 Malloc Lab

The original tar file is `malloclab-handout.tar` and the writeup is `malloclab.pdf`.

### Before starting 
Read `9.9` of `CSAPP: 3e` very carefully, make sure you understand each line of code.   

As indicated in the handout and the lecture, this could be the hardest among all labs. Be prepared.
